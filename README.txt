1 Introduction
==============

  P2X is a parser, configurable by shortcut grammars, with XML
  output. The parser uses recursive descent parsing to read any kind of
  text such as program code, configuration files or even natural
  language. The input is structured as a tree according to grammar rules
  which can be specified in a very concise and simple form. The XML
  output is in a form that makes unparsing particularly simple. This
  makes P2X suitable for the integration of non-XML data into XML-based
  projects and/or for source transformation using XSLT.
